LaunchpadPro
============

Bitwig Studio script to support Novations Launchpad Pro controller (MKII is not supported).

Differences from the original script from Mr.Moss:

* start in session view
* fix pressing clips in session view resulting in notes being triggered
* make autodetetction on windows work for me (device names differed)
* duplicate works like delete: hold it and select a clip to duplicate
* double works like delete: hold and select a empty slot to create a clip
* color scheme changed slightly
* recording knob toggles overdub
* shift+recording switches transport recording
* dont show armed track slots as red
